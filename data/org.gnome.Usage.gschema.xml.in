            <summary>minimum relative load (%) of an app to be displayed in the performance tab</summary>
            <description>
              The load an app has to have in total as the sum over all its
              processes, normalized to 100, to be listed in the performance tab.
              With 0, all apps are listed. With 100 an app is only listed if its
              processes fully utilise all CPU threads.

            <description>
              The minimum amount of memory an app has to use in total as the sum
              over all its processes in bytes to be listed in the performance
              tab.

            <summary>Force graphs to not continuously scrolling</summary>
            <description>
              If enabled, the performance graphs will be forced to not scroll
              continuously, but instead will only jump when a new data point is
              added.
              If disabled, the graphs will decide, based on power-saving mode
              and GTK's global animations settings, how to behave.
