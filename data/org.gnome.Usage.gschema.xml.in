            <description>
              The load an app has to have in total as the sum over all its
              processes, normalized to 1.00, to be listed in the performance
              tab. With 0.00, all apps are listed. With 1.00 an app is only
              listed if its processes fully utilise all CPU threads.

            <description>
              The minimum amount of memory an app has to use in total as the sum
              over all its processes in bytes to be listed in the performance
              tab.

            <summary>Force graphs to not continuously scrolling</summary>
            <description>
              If enabled, the performance graphs will be forced to not scroll
              continuously, but instead will only jump when a new data point is
              added.
              If disabled, the graphs will decide, based on power-saving mode
              and GTK's global animations settings, how to behave.
